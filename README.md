# Onepage Webapps

One page webapps created using only **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simple, single-page web applications built without any external frameworks or libraries. Each app is fully self-contained, demonstrating what can be achieved using just the core web technologies.

## Features

- 100% client-side: No backend required
- Pure HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Minimal dependencies
- Easy to deploy and use
- Great for learning and prototyping

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feddernico/onepage-webapps.git
   cd onepage-webapps
   ```

2. **Run an app:**
   - Method 1: Open any `.html` file in your browser, or
   - Method 2: Use a simple static server (for example, with Python):

     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server
     ```

   - Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Directory Structure

```
onepage-webapps/
├── common_resources/
│   ├── css
│   └── js
├── app1.html
├── app2.html
├── ...
└── README.md
```

- There is a common_resources folder that contains javascript and CSS that are reused across the various apss, and then each app is just an HTML file.
